# ESP8266-4channel-PWM-receiver
A WiFi receiver used to control quadcopters. It currently is coded for 4 channel output but can go to 8 or even beyond. This receiver was tested on YMFC AL Arduino Uno quadcopter

Access point details :-
SSID: WifiPPM
password: Wifi_PPM

PWM Channel Mapping:-
ch1 -> D4 - GPIO 2
ch2 -> D3 - GPIO 0
ch3 -> D1 - GPIO 5
ch4 -> D2 - GPIO 4

the project is based on WifiPPM project and changed to give PWM signals- https://www.instructables.com/Wifi-PPM-no-App-Needed/
